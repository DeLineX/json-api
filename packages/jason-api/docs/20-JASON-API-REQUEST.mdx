# Talking to an API

Below is a couple simple examples of action creators. The only required
attributes is `url`.  This will make a request to the given URL, normalize 
the response, and update the store. Additionally, since we set the `resourceType`
and `resourceId`, the meta data for that particular entity will be updated to
reflect `isLoading` and `error` status.

JasonAPI action creators also play nice with our Higher Order Components,
enabling intelligent caching, error-handling, and much more. There's plenty
of additional, helpful options; so be sure to check the WIKI.

```ts
import { jasonApiRequest } from 'jason-api';

const getUser = userId => jasonApiRequest({
    url: `/api/users/${userId}`,
    resourceType: 'users',
    resourceId: userId,
});

/**
 * NOTE: Since our payload contains the `type` and `id`, we can
 * choose to skip including those options like we did above.
 */
const updateUser = (userId, attributes) => jasonApiRequest({
    url: `/api/users/${userId}`,
    method: 'post',
    payload: {
        data: {
            type: 'users',
            id: userId,
            attributes,
        }
    },
});

// JASON_API_REQUEST action creators return a Promise when dispatched.
dispatch(getUser('12345')).then(response =>
    console.log(response.data.attributes.firstName)
);

// Or Use Await if that's your thing
const result = await dispatch(updateUser('12345', { firstName: 'Enrique' }));
console.log(result);
```

## jasonApiRequest() Options

The `jasonApiRequest()` action creator triggers an api call. A basic get request only requires a url.

```ts
import { jasonApiRequest } from 'jason-api';

const fetchBook = id => jasonApiRequest({
    url: `/api/books/${id}`,
});
```

There are plenty of other options, however, for customizing your requests with minimal code.

## Options

```ts
{
    // Defaults to 'get'
    method: 'get'|'post'|'patch'|'delete',

    // API route to hit
    url: <STRING>,

    // Optional payload to json-encode and pass along
    payload: <OBJECT>,

    // Additional headers to send along with the network request
    additionalHeaders: <OBJECT>,

    // If included without entityId, `loading` & `error` meta data is set for this entity type
    entityType: <STRING>,

    // If included with entityType, `loading` & `error` meta data is set for this specific entity
    entityId: <STRING>,

    // Optional function to call on success
    onSuccess: (response, { state, dispatch }) => void,

    // Do not dispatch the startLoadingActionCreator, if one was set using the `jsonApiMiddlewareFactory`
    disableStartLoadingActionCreator: <BOOLEAN>,

    // Optional function or response-code mapped object of functions to call on error.
    onError: (response, { state, dispatch }) => void,

    // If set to true, `displayErrorActionCreator` that was set using the
    // `jsonApiMiddlewareFactory` will be dispatched in the event of an error.
    displayNotificationOnError: <BOOLEAN>,

    // Set a relationship or relationships on success. Accepts an ID or
    // Array of ID's. If relationshipId is not provided, it will use the
    // JSON response. Will completely replace existing relationship(s).
    setRelationshipOnSuccess: [entityType, entityId, relationshipType, relationshipId],

    // Add a relationship on success. Ideal for one-to-many/many-to-many
    // relationships. If relationshipId is not provided, it will use the
    // JSON response. New relationships are appended to existing ones.
    addRelationshipOnSuccess: [entityType, entityId, relationshipType, relationshipId],

    // Remove a relationship on success. Ideal for one-to-many relationships.
    removeRelationshipOnSuccess: [entityType, entityId, relationshipType, relationshipId],

    // Remove an entity from the store on success
    removeEntityOnSuccess: [entityType, entityId],

    // Update an entity on success. Note that any
    // JSON API response will automatically be applied.
    updateEntityOnSuccess: [entityType, entityId, payload],

    // Optional function to transform incoming server
    // response before it is processed by the middleware.
    // It should return a valid JSON API response.
    transformer: <FUNCTION>
}
```
